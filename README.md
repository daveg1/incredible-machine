<h1 align=center>Arduino Dino Game</h1>

## Premise
A recreation of the famous Dino game that appears when you access chrome without a working internet connection (or if you access chrome://dino/) on an Arduino Uno.

## Features
- A 16x2 LCD screen to display the game on
- A button to jump with
- A potentiometer to activate dark mode

## Requirements
A finger to click the button with. My condolences to those without fingers.
